- 👋 Hi, I’m @GeraldHills
- 👀 I’m interested in personal coding projects to help me learn.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML for a small project for myself but I want to get into Unreal Engine work. I'm nt sure how that would integrate here but I'll figure it out as I go. I've created an Android app with Java but saved all of locally on my machine and would like to start integrating it into here somehow. I'm new to change control etc. whereby I'm used to just saving a V2, V3 as I go. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now. I'm still finding my way around.
- 📫 How to reach me, uh I don't know. Send me a message on here if possible?
